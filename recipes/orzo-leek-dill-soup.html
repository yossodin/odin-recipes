    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Vegan orzo and leek soup topped with fresh dill. A light and delicious soup recipe to enjoy in the winter or summer. I’ve used orzo but you can can swap this for pulses or grains such as bulgarwheat or couscous. This is ready in less than half an hour so brilliant for an easy dinner recipe.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 red onion</li>
        <li>3 large cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 carrot, diced</li>
        <li>1 leek</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried thyme</li>
        <li>5 oz orzo pasta</li>
        <li>6 cups vegetable stock</li>
        <li>4 sprigs fresh dill</li>
        <li>Salt & pepper to taste</li>
        <li>½ lemon, squeezed</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil to garnish</li>
        <li>Optional: Buttered and toasted Tuscan bread</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ol>
