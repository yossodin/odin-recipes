        <li>8 oz pasta</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium shallot</li>
        <li>8 oz mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>1 tsp fresh rosemary, minced</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp flour</li>
        <li>½ cup Marsala</li>
        <li>1 tsp wholegrain mustard</li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable stock</li>
        <li>¾ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 tsp fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Optional: Buttered and toasted Tuscan bread, steamed broccoli</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the pasta in salted water according to the instructions on the package and reserve some pasta water before draining.</li>
        <li>In a large pan, heat the olive oil and fry the shallot for 1 minute over medium heat until it softens.</li>
        <li>Next, add the mushrooms and rosemary to the pan and fry them for 8 to 10 minutes until they reduce in size and are slightly golden. Add the flour and stir to cover the mushrooms.</li>
        <li>Pour the Marsala and continue to cook for one to two minutes until the alcohol evaporates and you're left with a creamy sauce.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic and wholegrain mustard to the pan and stir to incorporate. Cook for another minute, then add the stock. Allow it to bubble for a minute, then add the double cream and cook for another 1-2 minutes until the sauce thickens.</li>
        <li>Stir in the fresh parsley, then transfer the pasta to the pan. Give it a good stir until it's well covered in sauce and season to taste.</li>
    </ol>
