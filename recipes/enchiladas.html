Enchiladas can be filled with various ingredients, including meats, cheese, beans, potatoes, vegetables, or combinations.

    <ul>
        <li>1 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup onion,finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded cooked chicken (rotisserie works well)</li>
        <li>15 oz black beans, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>4 oz can diced green chiles, undrained</li>
        <li>1 tsp chili powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>½ tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 cups enchilada sauce</li>
        <li>12 oz shredded cheese, Mexican blend</li>
        <li>8 large flour tortillas</li>
        <li>Optional: fresh cilantro, chopped green or red onion, sour cream, avocado, pico de gallo</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350° F</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until it starts to soften, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, 30 seconds. Turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked chicken, black beans, diced green chiles, chili powder, cumin, dried oregano, salt and ½ cup of the enchilada sauce to the skillet. Stir until well combined.</li>
        <li>Grease a 9×13-inch baking dish and spread ½ cup of enchilada sauce over the bottom of the dish. To assemble each enchilada, take one of the tortillas and put ½ cup of the chicken and bean mixture down the middle of the tortilla, slightly to the side of the center. Top with ⅓ cup of cheese.</li>
        <li>Roll up the tortilla as tightly as you can. Put the enchilada, seam side down, in the prepared baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas, enchilada filling and cheese.</li>
        <li>Spread the remaining sauce over the tops of the enchiladas. Sprinkle on the remaining cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake enchiladas for 20-25 minutes (uncovered), until hot and bubbly. Let rest for 5 minutes and then serve, with toppings as desired.</li>
    </ol>
